# Data Cleaning & Transformation Project

## Step 1: Data Import & Preparation 🚀

The journey begins! 🎉  
In this first step, I focused on preparing the dataset for analysis:

- **Uploaded Data**: Imported a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database.  
- **Automated Table Creation**: Used Python to dynamically create tables based on the structure of the CSV file, removing the need for manual column definitions.  
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaned the data by converting columns to more suitable formats for analysis.  

This is just the start—more steps in data cleaning, analysis, and insights generation are on the way. Stay tuned! 🛠️✨
